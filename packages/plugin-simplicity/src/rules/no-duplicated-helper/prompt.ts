 * PITFALL: keep the negative examples, and never take one from the evaluation corpus. The

 * identical, which is where a model over-reports.

  '  separator they split on is the whole difference between them. A shape is not a',
  '  responsibility, and two helpers that merely look alike are the commonest way to',
  '  be wrong here.',

Work from the bodies, and do not dismiss one because its name is different: a reimplementation always has a different name. That is what makes it hard to see.',
  '3. The ranking that put them there is crude — it counts shared words — so it can rank a stranger above a twin, and the twin may not be there at all. If none of these is it and you believe one exists, go and look: search_helper_bodies searches inside bodies for what the code DOES, such as `instanceof Error` or `.trim()`. Never search for the name. list_helpers, find_similar and get_helper are there too.',
  '4. Never decide from a name or a rank. Decide from a body you have read.',
  '5. Compare behavior against the rubric above, then decide. The order in which two helpers were shown to you means nothing.',
  '6. If it is a duplicate, call report_duplicate once. In `reason`, name the responsibility the two share, in at most twelve words. It is read at the end of a line, beside two names and a path — so name the shared job, not what each helper does, and not what should be done about it. "Both ask whether an error is a missing-file error." is the right length.',
